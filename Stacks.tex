%%  This is the main document for the Math 274 (Stacks) notes from      %%
%%  Spring 2007. To compile these notes, you should put the following   %%
%%  files in the same directory (these are all in FullStackSource.tgz,  %%
%%  by the way):                                                        %%
%%    Stacks.tex (this file), StacksPreamble.tex,                       %%
%%    StacksTitle.tex, StacksIntro.tex,                                 %%
%%    StacksAppendix.tex, StacksExercises.tex, StacksBibliography.tex,  %%
%%    StackLec01.tex, StackLec02.tex,..., StackLec44.tex                %%
%%  Then run 'latex Stacks.tex' (without quotes) three times (twice     %%
%%  might be enough).                                                   %%
%%                                                                      %%
%%  If you want to get a pdf, don't use pdflatex, because I use         %%
%%  pstricks. Instead, use latex, then dvips, then ps2pdf.              %%
%%                                                                      %%
