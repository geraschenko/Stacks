\sektion{0}{How these notes came to exist}

In Spring 2007, Martin Olsson taught ``Math 274---Topics in Algebra---Stacks'' at UC Berkeley. Anton Geraschenko \LaTeX ed these notes in class,\footnote{With the exception of two lectures (originally 30 and 31, but the content has been mixed up with nearby lectures), which were reconstructed from the notes of Tony Varilly, Ed Carter, and Anne Shiu, along with the usual conversation that went into editing.} and edited them with other people in the class. They still get modified sometimes. They should be available at\\
\url{https://github.com/geraschenko/Stacks}

The material from this course is now in professor Olsson's book \href{http://bookstore.ams.org/coll-62}{Algebraic Spaces and Stacks}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item When something doesn't make sense to me, I mark it with three
big, eye-catching
 stars \anton{like this}. If you can clear any of these up for me,
let me know.

 \item If you have notes that I'm missing or
 if you have a correct/clear explanation for something which is
incorrect/unclear, let
 me know (either tell me what you'd like to modify, give me some
notes to go on, or
 update the tex yourself and send me a copy). Real (mathematical)
errors should be
 fixed because it would be immoral to let them propagate (er \dots
that is, sit there),
 and typographical errors hardly take any time to fix, so you
shouldn't be shy about
 telling me about them.
\end{itemize}
