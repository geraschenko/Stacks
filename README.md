# Stacks

These are my notes from UC Berkeley Math 274, Algebraic Spaces and Stacks, taught by professor [Martin Olsson](https://math.berkeley.edu/~molsson) in Spring 2007.

The material from this course is now in professor Olsson's book [Algebraic Spaces and Stacks](http://bookstore.ams.org/coll-62).
